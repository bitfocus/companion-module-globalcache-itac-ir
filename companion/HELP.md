This is what you should get when capturing. Just copy the selected area in the bottom window to a text document for safe keeping and then just paste into companion. The ir field is set to only accept numbers and comma's, basically just the ir code. 38580,1,1,346,170,22,64,22,64,22,21,22,21,22,64,22,6, etc.... Make sure you don't add the sendir,1:1,1, info at the beginning that you get from the capture utility.
